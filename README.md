## About
Food tracker is an app that tracks the food a user has eaten. The app allows the user to track the name, calories, image, and any impressions the user had at the time of consumption. The user may want to track how many calories are in their favorite foods, how much food they have taken within a day, and/or have a place to write down the foods that they have enjoyed in order to consume that particular dish once more.
